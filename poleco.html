								<h3>Overview</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>The Asian Region as a whole is generally diverse with many different societies under its own umbrella from vibrant democracies to authoritarian regimes and everything in between.</li>
									<li>Globalization has created many upheavals with how politics and economics has played out in the regions with new major players emerging as the economic and cultural powerhouses with others becoming emerging areas of interest.</li>
									<li>The growth of their respective media industries and the embracing of new technologies has played a key role in the rapid development of many countries and cultural spheres all throughout the continent.</li>
									<li>The issues of economic inequality and political freedoms to the citizenry, and issues with equality are still major thorns to both major regions.</li>

								<h2>For the Middle East, political turmoil and economic uncertainty were abundant.</h2>
								</header>
								<p>There has been a steady drop in quality of life, with goods and unemployment rates increasing. This is felt in multiple areas such as in Egypt, Yemen, Libya and Syria. Despite the structural reforms and public protests, the economy continues to worsen. Due to this decline, as well as the presence of war, there has been a cascade of citizens leaving their countries. Governments countered these hardships “by adopting bigger fiscal policies, increasing wages, and pumping money into the market.” However, this resulted in rising debts, cutbacks on financial aid, and loosening restrictions on prices (Georgetown University Qatar, 2021). 

								Scholars from the Middle East claim that development with information and communication technologies (ICT) could prompt economic cooperation. ICTs have been neglected whereas these technologies can change manufacturing and commerce, as well as ease disputes because of its effect on the economy (Georgetown University Qatar, 2021).

								The emergence of “political communication actors” such as news channels contributed to the increase of interest in mass communication and affected studies on political communication. For example, Arab Spring that occurred in the years 2010 and 2011, was a sequence of protests concerning the crookedness of the government and the economic decline. This sparked research in “protest communication”. (Leihs & Roeder-Tzellos, 2015). </p>

								<h2>For Asia, ICTs were utilized extensively, however, there are little advances towards democracy</h2>
								<p>and many still remain in poverty (Mosco, 2009).</p>
								</header>
								<p>Asia may have contributed to the global economy, however, many Asian countries continue to struggle with corruption and poverty. In addition, there still exist problems such as natural calamities and “ethnic and religious conflicts” (Arnold, 2014). There is also a difference in how countries perceive democracy, with an unfortunate decline in such governance. As mentioned, this is aided by issues such as inequalities that exist between the wealthy and not, extortion, and the limitation of civil society (Ford & Hass, 2021).

								However, studies concerning ICTs and development were already prevalent in the past. Communication studies have been introduced early on, starting from the 1950s to the 1980s. As such, countries like Japan and Korea have prevalent research bodies that played a huge part in Asia’s mass communication. But regarding political communication, there aren’t many works and only a few countries have made progress (Willnat & Aw, 2004). 

								This limitation can be explained by the differing cultures and political systems in Asian countries. Many scholars from this region have studied in the United States, but it is difficult to apply Western theories to the East (Willnat & Aw, 2004).

							<h3>Both Asia and the Middle East hold significance in the global economy and global politics.</h3>
							<p>Asia houses “the world’s largest and most economically dynamic democracies” while the ongoing strife in the Middle East has international repercussions. Moreover, both regions are major producers of key resources and labor. With the two regions being considerable contributors and influencers internationally, it is only fair for proper development to occur in these areas which can be achieved with multimedia research.</p>
